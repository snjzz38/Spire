        <h3>Tier 3: Active Participation and Minor Leadership</h3>
        
        <p>This tier represents meaningful and consistent involvement in your activities. It shows that you are a reliable and engaged member of your community, which is a strong indicator to admissions officers of how you might participate in campus life.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistent Commitment:</strong> You are a dedicated member of a sports team, club, or volunteer organization, participating regularly over a significant period.</li>
            <li><strong>Minor Leadership Roles:</strong> You have taken on some responsibility, such as being a club treasurer, a section leader in the band, or the captain of the junior varsity team.</li>
            <li><strong>Substantive Contribution:</strong> You actively contribute to the group's goals, even without a formal title. For example, you might be the go-to person for organizing events or managing a specific project.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="examples">
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Being a dedicated member of the debate team for three years, consistently volunteering at a local animal shelter every weekend, or holding the position of secretary in the student council.
        </p>

        <h3>Tier 4: General Membership and Participation</h3>
        
        <p>These activities are the most common and represent the starting point of engagement. While they don't carry the same weight as higher-tiered activities, they are still valuable for showing that you are willing to explore different interests and be part of a group.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Membership:</strong> You are a member of several clubs but don't hold a specific leadership position or have major responsibilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Sporadic or Short-Term Involvement:</strong> This could include volunteering for a one-time event or joining a club for a single semester.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploring Interests:</strong> These activities often show a breadth of interests and a willingness to try new things.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="examples">
            <strong>Examples:</strong> Being a general member of the French club, participating in a school-wide charity drive for a week, or attending meetings for the environmental club.
        </p>

            <h4>Key Takeaway: Show Growth and Impact</h4>
            <p>The goal is to demonstrate a positive trajectory. An ideal application might show a journey where you started with Tier 4 activities (exploring interests) and progressed to Tier 3 activities (deeper commitment and minor leadership) in the areas you became most passionate about. This creates a compelling story of your personal and intellectual development.</p>

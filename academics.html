                <p>When you start thinking about university, you'll hear a lot about grades, GPAs, and standardized tests. They're the first thing admissions officers look at to see if you're a good fit.</p>

                <h2>Grades and What They Mean</h2>
                <p>Your grades are a primary way for universities to judge your academic potential. While a lot of people just think of them as a number, there's a lot more to it.</p>

                        <h4>üá∫üá∏ GPA (US System)</h4>
                        <p>In the United States, your grades are typically converted into a Grade Point Average (GPA). Universities often recalculate this GPA based on the difficulty of your classes and the context of your school. Essentially, if you take an easier course and get 95%, then it can be weighted less compared to a harder course where you got 92%.</p>

                        <h4>üá®üá¶ Percentage Grades (Canada & others)</h4>
                        <p>In many countries, like Canada, universities use a percentage-based grading system. They often have an "adjustment factor" for different high schools. This helps them balance out a percentage from a school known for giving high marks versus a percentage from a school that is notoriously difficult.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="system-card">
                        <h4>üåç International Systems</h4>
                        <p>Beyond these, there are many other systems. For example, the International Baccalaureate (IB) program uses a 7-point scale for its classes. Other European and Asian countries use their own unique systems. Each university is familiar with these different scales and knows how to evaluate them fairly.</p>

                <h2>The Importance of Course Rigor</h2>
                <p>Simply having good grades isn't always enough; universities also want to see that you challenged yourself. This is what's known as "course rigor." Taking more difficult classes shows that you're not afraid of a challenge and are ready for university-level work.</p>

                        <strong>Gifted & Honors Programs</strong>
                        Many schools offer specific programs for gifted or high-achieving students. These programs vary widely, but they typically offer a more rigorous curriculum. Ask your school counselor for details on any gifted or honors programs available at your school.

                <h2>The Role of Standardized Tests</h2>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>There is no magic number. Admissions officers value depth over breadth. It is far more impressive to have a deep, long-term commitment to 2-3 activities where you've shown growth and leadership than to be a passive member of 10 different clubs. Focus on what you are genuinely passionate about.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Your GPA and the rigor of your courses are generally the most important factor. They reflect your academic performance over four years, not just on a single day. However, with many universities being "test-optional," the emphasis on your transcript has become even greater. If you do submit scores, they are considered as another important data point in a holistic review.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p><strong>Early Decision (ED)</strong> is a binding commitment, meaning if you are accepted, you must attend. You should only apply ED if you have a clear first-choice university and are certain you can afford it. ED can sometimes offer a slight statistical advantage in admissions. <strong>Regular Decision (RD)</strong> is non-binding and allows you to apply to multiple schools and compare financial aid offers before making a choice.</p>

                        <summary>What should I write my main application essay about?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Your essay should be a personal story that reveals something important about your character, values, or perspective that can't be found elsewhere in your application. Focus on reflection. It's not just about *what* happened, but *why* it mattered to you and how it shaped who you are today. Be authentic and write in your own voice.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>No. Admissions officers practice "holistic review," which means they evaluate you within the context of your environment. They will see a profile from your school that shows what advanced courses were available to you. Your goal is to show that you took advantage of the most challenging curriculum available at your specific school.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Ask a teacher from a core junior-year subject who knows you well and in whose class you actively participated. Ask them in person at least one month before the deadline. To help them, provide a "brag sheet" that includes your resume, a list of schools you're applying to, and a few reminders of specific projects or discussions from their class that you are proud of.</p>
